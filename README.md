# Paperplane Survivor

My first mobile game, coded in Solar2D. Solar2D is a framework of Lua programming language. It was named as Corona SDK for years. Commonly used for 2d mobile games but even PC apps are creatable.

Game's Google Play Store link : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.slckkrksz.paperplanesurvivor

After the splashscreen, you can use Settings to pick one of 4 different planes and 4 different game modes. There is also Highscores interface that keeps highest scores in JSON files. And game.lua is the main flow.

Got help from this script for the movement of the plane : https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/
